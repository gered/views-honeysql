# views-honeysql

HoneySQL plugin for the [views](https://github.com/gered/views) library.


###  This repository is an experimental fork!

I've made some breaking and possibly contentious changes in this fork
with the end goal of simplifying usage of this library (and hopefully
improving it in the process).

This will be lacking in documentation and usage examples until I mostly
finalize all the changes I'm intending on making.
